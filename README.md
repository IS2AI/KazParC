## Domains ‚ÑπÔ∏è

<p align = "justify">We collected data for our Kazakh Parallel Corpus (referred to as KazParC) from a diverse range of textual sources. These sources include</p> 

- proverbs and sayings
- terminology glossaries
- phrasebooks
- literary works
- periodicals
- language learning materials, including the SCoRE corpus by <a href = "https://www.torrossa.com/en/resources/an/5000845#page=118">Chujo et al. (2015)</a>
- educational video subtitle collections, such as QED by <a href = "http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/877_Paper.pdf">Abdelali et al. (2014)</a>
- news items, such as KazNERD (<a href = "https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.44.pdf">Yeshpanov et al., 2022</a>) and WMT (<a href = "http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/463_Paper.pdf">Tiedemann, 2012</a>)
- <a href = "https://www.ted.com/">TED</a> talks
- <a href = "https://adilet.zan.kz/">governmental and regulatory legal documents from Kazakhstan</a>
- communications from <a href = "https://www.akorda.kz/">the official website of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan</a>

- image captions from sources like <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf%090.949.pdf">COCO</a>

We categorized the data acquired from these sources into five broad domains:

1. Education and science
2. Fiction
3. General
4. Legal documents
5. Mass media

## Data Collection üìÖ

<p align = "justify">We started the data collection process in July 2021, and it continued until September 2023. During this period, we collected a vast amount of text materials and their translations.<br><br>
Our team of linguists played a crucial role in ensuring the quality of the data. They carefully reviewed the collected data, screening it for inappropriate content. The next step involved segmenting the data into individual sentences, with each sentence labelled with a source identifier. We also paid close attention to grammar and spelling accuracy and removed any duplicate sentences.<br><br>
Kazakh-Russian <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching">code-switching</a> is a common practice in Kazakhstan, so we took steps to maintain uniformity. For sentences containing both Kazakh and Russian words, we initiated a modification process. This process involved translating the Russian elements into Kazakh while preserving the intended meaning of the sentences.</p>

## Data Pre-Processing üßπ

<p align = "justify">We organised the data into language pairs. We then carefully removed any unwanted characters and effectively replaced <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph">homoglyphs</a>.
We also took care of formatting issues by eliminating line breaks (\n) and carriage returns (\r).
We identified and removed duplicate entries, making sure to filter out rows with identical text in both language columns. 
However, to make our corpus more diverse and include a broader range of synonyms for different words and expressions, we decided to keep lines with duplicate text within a single language column.</p>
